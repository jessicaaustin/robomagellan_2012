  # since our robot has three degrees of freedom: position in X,Y and orientation, 
  # but we can only control two degrees of freedom our robot is non-holonomic
  # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic
  holonomic_robot: false

  # Set the tolerance on achieving a goal
  # We set this rather high because we don't care about achieving intermediate waypoints
  # exactly, and cone waypoints will be captured by the cone_capture node

  # we don't care at all what the yaw is when reaching a goal
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 6.28

  # the amount of time to forward-simulate trajectories, in seconds
  # higher sim_time generally implies smoother trajectories, but also
  # requires a higher xy_goal_tolerance. since our xy_goal_tolerance is high,
  # we can afford to have a high sim_time

  # how much the controller should try to reach its local goal 
  # our goal_distance_bias >>> path_distance_bias because we don't have a good map,
  # so our paths are generally crap
